# 🔄 Branch Reorganization Implementation

## Current Status: ✅ Ready for Manual Execution

### What Has Been Done
1. ✅ Analyzed repository structure and commit history
2. ✅ Verified both target commits exist:
   - `93c0b2ce4c2f8895e7ce85e7d6193d03b5d364ad` (for development)
   - `5aa8a06cd07686cd635c3995121cd0dd0573dda9` (for main)
3. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
4. ✅ Created automated script for execution
5. ✅ Created quick reference guide in Chinese
6. ✅ Locally tested branch creation (development branch created successfully)

### What Needs Manual Execution
Due to GitHub security restrictions, the following operations **require manual execution by a repository administrator**:

#### Operation 1: Create Development Branch ✅ (Partially Complete)
- **Status**: Branch created locally but not pushed
- **Target**: `93c0b2ce4c2f8895e7ce85e7d6193d03b5d364ad`
- **Command**: `git push origin development`

#### Operation 2: Reset Main Branch ⚠️ (Requires Admin)
- **Status**: Requires force push with admin permissions
- **Target**: `5aa8a06cd07686cd635c3995121cd0dd0573dda9`
- **Command**: `git push origin main --force`
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Force push to main branch

## 🚀 Quick Start for Repository Owner

### Option A: Use the Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository if not already cloned
git clone https://github.com/PoLin8922/moneyTracker.git
cd moneyTracker

# Run the automated script
./reorganize_branches.sh
```

### Option B: Manual Step-by-Step
```bash
# Step 1: Fetch all history
git fetch --all --unshallow || git fetch --all

# Step 2: Create and push development branch
git checkout -b development 93c0b2ce4c2f8895e7ce85e7d6193d03b5d364ad
git push origin development

# Step 3: Reset and push main branch (REQUIRES ADMIN)
git checkout main
git reset --hard 5aa8a06cd07686cd635c3995121cd0dd0573dda9

# You may need to disable branch protection temporarily
git push origin main --force
```

## 📋 Pre-Execution Checklist

Before executing the branch reorganization, ensure:

- [ ] You have admin/maintainer permissions on the repository
- [ ] Main branch protection is disabled or you have override permissions
- [ ] All team members are notified about the branch reorganization
- [ ] Important data is backed up
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline status is checked
- [ ] All open pull requests are reviewed and their base branches noted

## 🛡️ Safety Measures

### 1. Backup Current State
```bash
# Create a backup branch before any changes
git checkout main
git branch backup-main-before-reset
git push origin backup-main-before-reset
```

### 2. GitHub Branch Protection Settings
You may need to temporarily:
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Edit "main" branch protection rule
3. Temporarily disable "Do not allow bypassing the above settings" or force push restrictions
4. Re-enable after the operation

### 3. Rollback Plan
If something goes wrong:
```bash
# Restore from backup
git checkout main
git reset --hard backup-main-before-reset
git push origin main --force

# Or restore to original state
git reset --hard 93c0b2ce4c2f8895e7ce85e7d6193d03b5d364ad
git push origin main --force
```

## 📊 Expected Results

After successful execution:

### Before
```
main → 93c0b2c (fix: 增強錯誤日誌以診斷伺服器回應問題)
[development branch doesn't exist]
```

### After
```
main → 5aa8a06 (feat: 整合記帳類別到預算分配選擇器)
development → 93c0b2c (fix: 增強錯誤日誌以診斷伺服器回應問題)
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After execution, verify with:

```bash
# Check branches exist
git branch -a | grep -E '(main|development)'

# Verify main commit
git log main -1 --oneline
# Should show: 5aa8a06 feat: 整合記帳類別到預算分配選擇器

# Verify development commit
git log development -1 --oneline
# Should show: 93c0b2c fix: 增強錯誤日誌以診斷伺服器回應問題

# Visual verification
git log --graph --oneline --all -20
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Force Push Warning**: This operation involves force-pushing to the main branch, which can be destructive
2. **Team Coordination**: Ensure all team members pull the latest changes after execution
3. **Open PRs**: Review all open pull requests - they may need to change their base branch
4. **CI/CD**: Some CI/CD runs may fail after the reset - this is expected
5. **Deployment**: If main is auto-deployed, the deployment will roll back to the older version

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution**: Ensure you have push permissions or use SSH authentication

### Issue: "protected branch hook declined"
**Solution**: Disable branch protection temporarily (requires admin)

### Issue: "Updates were rejected"
**Solution**: Use `--force` flag (but be careful!)

### Issue: "Commit not found"
**Solution**: Run `git fetch --all --unshallow` to get full history

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the detailed documentation in `BRANCH_REORGANIZATION.md`
2. Review the troubleshooting section above
3. Contact the repository administrator
4. Review GitHub's documentation on branch management
